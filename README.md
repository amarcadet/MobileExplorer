# MobileExplorer

Mobile Explorer is a small OS X app that display applications installed on an iOS device. 

I made it for test purposes back in 2011 and push it to GitHub in 2014. Source code has been updated to match current standards (i.e removed `@synthesize` and `@dynamic`, removed category name for private `@interface`, and so on).
