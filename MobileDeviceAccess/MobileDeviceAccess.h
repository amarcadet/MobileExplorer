/*! \mainpage MobileDeviceAccess
 *
 * This module is intended to provide access to the iPhone and iPod Touch file systems.
 * It achieves this via the same mechanism that iTunes uses, relying on direct entry
 * points into an undocumented private framework provided by Apple.
 *
 * It will be necessary to include /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileDevice.framework
 * in any project using this library
 *

 * \section intro_sec Typical Usage
 *
 * The application delegate will usually register itself as a listener to the MobileDeviceAccess
 * singleton.  It will then be called back for every iPhone and iPod Touch that connects.  To access
 * files on the AMDevice, create one of the subclasses AFCDirectoryAccess using the 
 * corresponding \p -newAFCxxxDirectory: method.
 *
 * \section refs_sec References
 *
 * This is based on information extracted from around the Internet, by people
 * who wanted to look a lot further under the covers than I did.  I've deliberately
 * pushed all Apple's datatypes back to being opaque, since there is nothing
 * to be gained by looking inside them, and everything to lose.
 *
 * This library doesn't contain any of the 'recovery-mode' or other 'jailbreak-related' stuff
 *
 * Some of the places I looked include:
 * - http://iphonesvn.halifrag.com/svn/iPhone/
 * - http://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=MobileDevice_Library
 * - http://code.google.com/p/iphonebrowser/issues/detail?id=52
 * - http://www.koders.com/csharp/fidE79340F4674D47FFF3EFB6F949A1589D942798F3.aspx
 * - http://iphone-docs.org/doku.php?id=docs:protocols:screenshot
 * I can't guarantee that they're still there.
